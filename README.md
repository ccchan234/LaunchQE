# LaunchQE
LaunchQ enhanced with "no need keyboard" + could Send.

bug:
even you use original author's v2.5, there are several entries wont show up in the bottom,
my solution is to make several (say 5) entries like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz1.text zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz2.text to fill the bottom part so all other entries will be pushed up and thus all useful entries are shown

ps the ico seems is from common creative, just included for reference.
